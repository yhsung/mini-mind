# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a cross-platform mindmap application designed for macOS, Windows, and iOS. The application enables users to visually capture, organize, and share ideas in a highly interactive mind-mapping environment, providing an intuitive interface for individual users and teams to brainstorm, plan projects, or take structured notes with seamless synchronization across devices and platforms.

The application targets knowledge workers, engineers, students, educators, creative professionals, and corporate teams who need powerful visual thinking tools for ideation, project planning, and collaboration.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This mindmap application aligns with modern productivity software principles by:
- Providing a local-first, privacy-focused approach to data management
- Enabling seamless cross-platform experiences through unified codebase architecture
- Supporting both individual productivity and collaborative workflows
- Prioritizing performance and accessibility across all supported platforms

## Requirements

### REQ-MM-001: Core Mindmap Creation and Editing

**User Story:** As a knowledge worker, I want to create and edit mindmaps with interconnected nodes, so that I can visually organize my thoughts and ideas in a structured way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new mindmap THEN the system SHALL provide a central root node ready for editing
2. WHEN a user adds a new node THEN the system SHALL create it as a child of the selected parent node with automatic layout positioning
3. WHEN a user edits node text THEN the system SHALL support rich text formatting including bold, italics, and code formatting
4. WHEN a user connects nodes THEN the system SHALL support both parent-child hierarchical relationships and cross-links between any nodes
5. IF a user presses Enter on a selected node THEN the system SHALL create a sibling node at the same hierarchy level
6. IF a user presses Tab on a selected node THEN the system SHALL create a child node one level deeper

### REQ-MM-002: Multi-Layout Support

**User Story:** As a user organizing different types of information, I want multiple layout options for my mindmaps, so that I can choose the most appropriate visual structure for my content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects layout options THEN the system SHALL provide radial, tree, and force-directed layout algorithms
2. WHEN a layout is changed THEN the system SHALL smoothly animate the transition between layouts
3. WHEN nodes are repositioned THEN the system SHALL maintain readable spacing and avoid overlaps
4. IF a mindmap has more than 100 nodes THEN the system SHALL use incremental layout updates for performance

### REQ-MM-003: Drag and Drop Interaction

**User Story:** As a visual thinker, I want to drag and drop nodes to reorganize my mindmap, so that I can quickly restructure my ideas as they evolve.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user drags a node THEN the system SHALL provide real-time visual feedback with smooth animations
2. WHEN a node is dropped on another node THEN the system SHALL make it a child of the target node
3. WHEN a node is dropped on empty space THEN the system SHALL maintain its current relationships but update its position
4. WHEN nodes are moved THEN the system SHALL automatically update connecting lines and maintain visual clarity

### REQ-MM-004: Search and Navigation

**User Story:** As a user with large mindmaps, I want to quickly find and navigate to specific nodes, so that I can efficiently locate information without manual browsing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types in the search box THEN the system SHALL provide real-time fuzzy search results
2. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL highlight matching nodes and allow quick navigation
3. WHEN a user selects a search result THEN the system SHALL center the view on the selected node and highlight it
4. IF search returns multiple results THEN the system SHALL provide keyboard shortcuts to cycle through matches

### REQ-MM-005: File Import and Export

**User Story:** As a user transitioning from other mindmap tools, I want to import existing mindmaps and export my work, so that I can maintain interoperability with other systems and collaborate with users of different tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user imports a file THEN the system SHALL support OPML, FreeMind (.mm), and Markdown outline formats
2. WHEN a user exports a mindmap THEN the system SHALL provide PDF, SVG, PNG, OPML, and Markdown outline formats
3. WHEN importing files THEN the system SHALL preserve node hierarchy, text content, and basic styling where possible
4. WHEN exporting visual formats THEN the system SHALL maintain high resolution and readable text at standard print sizes

### REQ-MM-006: Attachment and Media Support

**User Story:** As a user creating comprehensive mindmaps, I want to attach files, images, and links to nodes, so that I can create rich, multimedia-enhanced mind maps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds an attachment THEN the system SHALL support images, documents, and external links
2. WHEN an image is attached THEN the system SHALL display a thumbnail preview on the node
3. WHEN a link is attached THEN the system SHALL provide click-through functionality and URL validation
4. WHEN files are attached THEN the system SHALL store references and provide access through the native file system

### REQ-MM-007: Local Data Persistence

**User Story:** As a user creating valuable content, I want my mindmaps automatically saved and recoverable, so that I never lose my work due to crashes or unexpected shutdowns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes changes THEN the system SHALL auto-save every 30 seconds or after significant edits
2. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL restore the last working state including open files and view positions
3. WHEN the system crashes THEN the system SHALL recover unsaved changes on next startup
4. WHEN a user performs actions THEN the system SHALL maintain unlimited undo/redo history for the current session

### REQ-MM-008: Cross-Platform Consistency

**User Story:** As a user working across multiple devices, I want consistent functionality and interface, so that I can seamlessly switch between my Mac, PC, and iOS devices without learning different interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs on different platforms THEN the system SHALL provide identical core functionality
2. WHEN using keyboard shortcuts THEN the system SHALL adapt to platform conventions (Cmd on Mac, Ctrl on PC)
3. WHEN the interface is displayed THEN the system SHALL follow platform-specific design guidelines while maintaining brand consistency
4. WHEN features are available THEN the system SHALL ensure feature parity across macOS, Windows, and iOS platforms

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Application startup time must be under 10 seconds from launch to first usable mindmap
- Node manipulation operations (add, edit, move) must complete within 16ms (60 FPS) on mid-range hardware
- The system must handle mindmaps with up to 10,000 nodes while maintaining responsive performance
- Memory usage must remain under 512MB for typical mindmaps (under 1,000 nodes)

### Security
- All user data must be stored locally by default with no required cloud dependencies
- Optional cloud synchronization must use end-to-end encryption with XChaCha20-Poly1305
- The application must implement privacy-by-design principles with minimal telemetry
- Crash reporting and analytics must be opt-in only

### Reliability
- Application crash rate must be below 1% across all supported platforms
- Data corruption incidents must be below 0.1% of save operations
- The system must gracefully handle and recover from file system errors
- Backup and recovery mechanisms must ensure no data loss during normal operation

### Usability
- The interface must be fully accessible with screen reader compatibility
- High contrast themes must be available for visually impaired users
- All interactive elements must support keyboard navigation
- Touch targets on iOS must meet Apple's minimum size guidelines (44pt)
- The learning curve for basic operations must be under 15 minutes for new users
