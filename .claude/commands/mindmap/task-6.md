### Design
# Design Document

## Overview

This document describes the technical design for a cross-platform mindmap application built with Flutter UI and Rust core engine. The application provides a high-performance, native-feeling experience across macOS, Windows, and iOS platforms, with a local-first architecture that supports optional cloud synchronization and real-time collaboration features.

The design leverages Flutter's cross-platform capabilities for consistent UI/UX while utilizing Rust's performance and memory safety for core computational tasks including graph algorithms, layout computation, and data persistence.

## Steering Document Alignment

### Technical Standards (tech.md)
*No existing tech.md found - establishing new technical standards:*
- **Language Choice**: Flutter (Dart) for UI layer, Rust for core engine via FFI
- **Architecture Pattern**: Layered architecture with clear separation between UI, business logic, and data layers
- **Performance**: Target 60 FPS rendering with <16ms operation latency
- **Security**: Local-first with end-to-end encryption for optional cloud features
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end testing strategy

### Project Structure (structure.md)
*No existing structure.md found - establishing new project organization:*
- **Monorepo Structure**: Separate Flutter app and Rust core in organized directory structure
- **Platform-Specific Code**: Minimal platform-specific implementations using Flutter's platform channels
- **Shared Resources**: Common assets, themes, and configuration files
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation and architectural decision records

## Code Reuse Analysis

Since this is a greenfield project, there is no existing code to leverage. However, the design establishes patterns for future extensibility and component reuse:

### Foundation Components to Build
- **Base Widget Architecture**: Reusable Flutter widgets following Material Design principles
- **State Management**: Centralized state management using Provider/Riverpod pattern
- **FFI Bridge**: Rust-Flutter interface layer for seamless integration
- **Cross-Platform Services**: Unified API layer abstracting platform-specific functionality

### Integration Points to Establish
- **File System Integration**: Native file picker and storage access across platforms
- **Platform Services**: Integration with iCloud Drive (iOS/macOS), OneDrive (Windows)
- **Input Methods**: Support for keyboard, mouse, touch, and Apple Pencil inputs
- **Export Services**: Integration with platform sharing and printing services

## Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

- **Simplified Rendering:** Use simplified shapes and reduced text for distant nodes
- **Dynamic Quality:** Adjust rendering quality based on device performance and battery level
- **Smooth Transitions:** Animate between detail levels to maintain visual continuity
